## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

### 1. **Duplicate Code** üî¥ BLOCKER
**Problem:** Two parallel implementations exist:
- `/src/app/components/` (old, uses ApiService)
- `/src/app/features/` (new, uses core services)

**Impact:** Confusion, maintenance nightmare, increased bundle size

**Solution:** Delete `/components` directory and unused `ApiService`

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

### 2. **Missing Edit Functionality** üü° HIGH PRIORITY
**Problem:** Edit button doesn't work, just logs to console

**Impact:** Users cannot modify existing todos

**Solution:** Create edit modal with form

**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

### 3. **No Category Service** üü° HIGH PRIORITY
**Problem:** Categories exist in DB but no service to manage them

**Impact:** Cannot add/edit/delete categories

**Solution:** Create CategoryService with CRUD methods

**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

### 4. **Admin Dashboard Static Data** üü† MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Problem:** Admin shows hardcoded numbers instead of real data

**Impact:** Admin features appear non-functional

**Solution:** Connect to JSON Server systemMetrics and users endpoints

**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

## üìù NOTES

### What's Working Well
- ‚úÖ Clean, modern Angular 18 architecture
- ‚úÖ Proper TypeScript typing throughout
- ‚úÖ Good component separation
- ‚úÖ Responsive design
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive E2E test suite
- ‚úÖ JSON Server mock backend is perfect for development

### Pain Points
- ‚ùå Duplicate code causing confusion
- ‚ùå Some features appear functional but aren't connected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Admin dashboard needs significant work
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced features (subtasks, tags) have backend models but no UI

### User Feedback
- Login and registration work flawlessly
- Todo creation is intuitive
- Statistics cards provide good overview
- Filters work well
- Edit button not working is frustrating
- Admin dashboard feels incomplete

---

## üìû STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION

### What to Tell Management
> "The application's core functionality is **85% complete**. Users can register, login, and perform full todo management operations. The user dashboard is production-ready. We have ~10-15 days of work remaining to complete all features and migrate from mock backend to production backend with MongoDB."

### What to Tell QA Team
> "Please focus testing on: login, registration, todo CRUD operations, and filtering. Known issues: Edit button is placeholder only, admin dashboard shows static data, category management is UI-only. E2E test suite exists but needs review."

### What to Tell Design Team
> "All wireframes have been implemented for user-facing features. Admin dashboard layout exists but needs UX review. Consider designing: edit modal, settings page, notification panel, calendar view."
