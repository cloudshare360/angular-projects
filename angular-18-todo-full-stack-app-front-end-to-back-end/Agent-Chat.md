in the current folder,
I am developing Angular 18 Front-Back a fullstack Development with MEAN Stack; 
I created files 
1. requrements.md
2. agent-traker.md

analyse the current project, check the requirements, update the current agent traker. 
after analysis, update the agent traker.
execute the task one after other



points to remember
1. every time a new task is added, requirements document will be updated
2. after every task, update the agent traker
3. commit and push the changes  after every task execution
4. estimat the total number of hours spent
5. create a claude-spend-report.md; estimate the claude agent consumption required to spend on each task and over all project cost interms claude spent amount; update this after every task completion;
use following urls to fetch the cost
https://claude.ai/settings/billing, 
https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing; 
The way I want to claude cost spent repot is 
Project Name
tokens used, cost

Front-End Section

Front-App Development
Front-End Task/Sub task: Total Token used, Total Cost
Front-End : Total Tokens used, Total Cost Account (Claude Subscription/Anthropic API)

Do the following - for angular front-end
1. read the requirement document
2. read the agenet tracker document
3. analyse the code 
4. create a folder project-status-repot
4.1 create html report
4.2 create the scripts to start and view html report
based on the code analysis in step 3 and comparing against step 2
create a project status html repot; keep the data in json and render the html document
4.3.1 list each feature, task, sub task
4.3.2. update the status against each feature, task, sub task
