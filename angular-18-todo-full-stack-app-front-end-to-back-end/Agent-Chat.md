in the current folder,
I am developing Angular 18 Front-Back a fullstack Development with MEAN Stack; 
I created files 
1. requrements.md
2. agent-traker.md

analyse the current project, check the requirements, update the current agent traker. 
after analysis, update the agent traker.
execute the task one after other

points to remember
1. every time a new task is added, requirements document will be updated
2. after every task, update the agent traker
3. commit and push the changes  after every task execution
4. estimat the total number of hours spent
5. create a claude-spend-report.md; estimate the claude agent consumption required to spend on each task and over all project cost interms claude spent amount; update this after every task completion;
use following urls to fetch the cost
https://claude.ai/settings/billing, 
https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing; 
The way I want to claude cost spent repot is 
Project Name
tokens used, cost
