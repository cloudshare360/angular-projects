## 🐛 Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Login Redirect Failure ⚠️ BLOCKER
**Severity**: P0 - Critical
**Impact**: Blocks 100% of authenticated functionality
**Status**: Root cause identified

**Symptoms**:
```
- User enters valid credentials
- Form submits successfully
- API returns success with JWT token
- Page stays on login with error: "An error occurred. Please try again."
- No redirect to dashboard
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
```
Layer 1 - Database: ✅ Working
  - MongoDB running and healthy
  - User credentials exist in database

Layer 2 - Backend API: ✅ Working
  - Login endpoint responds correctly
  - Returns valid JWT token
  - curl test shows: {"success":true,"data":{"user":{...},"token":"eyJ..."}}

Layer 3 - Frontend/Proxy: ❌ ISSUE FOUND
  - Proxy configuration had "secure": true for HTTP backend
  - This causes proxy to reject HTTP connections
  - API calls through proxy fail silently
  - Direct API call works, proxied call returns HTML
```

**Fix Applied**:
```json
// File: Front-End/angular-18-todo-app/proxy.conf.json
// Changed from:
{
  "/api/*": {
    "target": "http://localhost:3000",
    "secure": true,  // ❌ WRONG for HTTP
    ...
  }
}

// Changed to:
{
  "/api/*": {
    "target": "http://localhost:3000",
    "secure": false,  // ✅ CORRECT for HTTP
    ...
  }
}
```

**Verification Steps Required**:
1. ❌ Angular dev server NOT restarted yet (fix not active)
2. ⏳ Need to restart Angular with: `npm start`
3. ⏳ Re-run E2E tests after restart
4. ⏳ Verify login redirects to dashboard

**Expected Impact After Fix**:
- 📈 Test pass rate: 53% → 90%+ expected
- ✅ Login will redirect to dashboard
- ✅ All dashboard tests will run
- ✅ All workflow tests will run

---

### Issue #2: Registration Not Creating Users
**Severity**: P1 - High
**Impact**: New users cannot register

**Symptoms**:
```
- Registration form submits
- Page stays on registration
- No error message shown
- User not created in database
```

**Investigation Needed**:
1. Check backend logs for registration attempts
2. Verify registration endpoint payload format
3. Check Angular form validation
4. Verify confirmPassword handling (form doesn't have this field)

---

### Issue #3: Dashboard UI Components Missing
**Severity**: P2 - Medium
**Impact**: Cannot create/manage todos from UI

**Symptoms**:
```
Test logs show:
  ❌ Could not find create list button
  ❌ Could not find add todo button
  ❌ Could not find logout button
```

**Possible Causes**:
1. Material Dialog components not properly imported
2. Buttons not rendered due to missing data
3. Button selectors incorrect in tests
4. Components conditionally hidden

**Investigation Needed**:
1. Manually access dashboard (once login fixed)
2. Verify Material modules imported
3. Check component templates for buttons
4. Verify data-testid attributes added correctly
