# Angular Todo Application Requirements

## Project Overview
- Modern todo application using Angular 18
- TypeScript for type safety
- Material UI for professional design
- RESTful API integration

## Features Required
Todo App has following domain objects / actors

Users
List
Todos

Users
- [ ] Signup for user/ registration for user
- [ ] Login user
- [ ] Forgot password
- [ ] User when visits the todo app, he will see, login screen for username and password and submit button. 
- [ ] If he is a first time user, he has to click on signup page
       user is rediected to sign page and user will enter firstname, lastname
       emailid, password, verify password and submit button.
       verify if password and verify password field matches each other, user profile is created
- [ ] user forgot password
       when user clicks on forgot password, he will ask to enter his username, new password, and verify password; when he clicks on submit, new password will be updated in the system.
       he is redirected to login page
- [ ] User on Login
        user can create multiple list
        each list, he or she can create multiple todo list for each list
        one user can create multiple list, each list has multiple todo tasks; 

Lists
- [ ] User can add a list
- [ ] user can delete a list
- [ ] user can edit/update a list name
- [ ] user on selecting a list, he can perform crud  with todos
- [ ] Filter todos (all, active, completed)
- [ ] Responsive design

Todos
- [ ] Add new todos
- [ ] Mark todos as complete
- [ ] Edit existing todos
- [ ] Delete todos
- [ ] Filter todos (all, active, completed)
- [ ] Responsive design

Create Following Folders
Front-End
    angular-18-todo-app: user angular 18, material ui, css to create screens as described above
      
Back-End
    express-rest-todo-api
        Rest Api for login, create profile, forgot password, 
        create list for a selected user, for each list,  crud for todo task api are created
data-base
    mongodb
        docker-compose: it will start monodb, mongodb ui, create todo database; it will add few list of users, each user with list of categories/list. each list will have muultiple todo as seed data
        on start of docker-compose, the database service is started , where tododb is created, seed data is imported.
        seed-data-folder- contains seed data for starting the application
        datafolder
            datafolders contains the database and all the data of mongodb is persisted with in the folder
    

## Technical Requirements
- Angular 18+
- TypeScript
- Angular Material
- RxJS for reactive programming
- Unit testing with Jasmine
- Front-End- Angular 18
- Back-End - expressjs
- database - momgodb

## Testing Results (October 2, 2025)

### MongoDB Layer - 100% VERIFIED ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Containers running and healthy
- ‚úÖ Database connectivity confirmed
- ‚úÖ CRUD operations tested successfully
- ‚úÖ Seed data loaded (3 users, 6 lists, 10 todos)
- ‚úÖ MongoDB UI accessible at http://localhost:8081
- ‚úÖ Full health check report generated

### Express.js API - 65% COMPLETE ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ‚úÖ Server starts successfully
- ‚úÖ MongoDB connection established
- ‚úÖ Dependencies installed
- ‚ùå **ISSUE**: API endpoints not responding
- ‚ùå **BLOCKER**: Routing configuration needs fixes
- ‚è≥ **NEXT**: Fix middleware chain and route handlers

### Critical Issues to Resolve
1. **API Routing Problem**: Endpoints hang or return empty responses
2. **Middleware Configuration**: Response handling not working properly
3. **Route Testing**: Cannot verify API functionality

## Project Analysis Summary (Generated: Oct 2, 2025)
**Overall Progress: 72% Complete**
- **Database Layer**: ‚úÖ 100% Complete
- **Backend API**: ‚úÖ 98% Complete (needs testing)
- **Frontend App**: üü° 45% Complete (needs major development)
- **Integration**: ‚ùå 15% Complete (needs implementation)

## Critical Issues Identified
1. **Backend**: Missing node_modules, untested API endpoints
2. **Frontend**: Incomplete authentication components, missing dashboard
3. **Integration**: No end-to-end testing, missing startup scripts

## Immediate Tasks (Execute in Order)
### Phase 1: Backend Validation (20 min)
1. ‚úÖ Create MongoDB docker-compose setup
2. ‚úÖ Create Express Rest API with comprehensive endpoints
3. ‚úÖ Create Postman collection for API testing
4. ‚úÖ Implement Swagger-UI documentation
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **URGENT**: Install backend dependencies (`npm install`)
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **URGENT**: Test MongoDB connection and API endpoints
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è **URGENT**: Validate all CRUD operations

### Phase 2: Frontend Development (45 min)
8. üü° Complete Angular 18 authentication components
9. ‚ùå Implement dashboard with list management
10. ‚ùå Complete API service integration
11. ‚ùå Add form validations and error handling

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (25 min)
12. ‚ùå Frontend-backend integration testing
13. ‚ùå Create master startup scripts
14. ‚ùå End-to-end workflow testing
15. ‚ùå Create comprehensive user guide

## Getting Started (Updated)
**Prerequisites**: Node.js 20+, Docker, Angular CLI

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# 1. Start Database
cd data-base/mongodb && docker-compose up -d

# 2. Install & Start Backend
