I created following files
1. requirements.md
2. project-status-tracker.md

do following

1. scan entire project, do project code analysis, create a project-analysis html report
2. verify the requirements, project-status-tracker against project-analysis html report
3. based on it update the requirements, project-status-tracker;
4. to complete the project what are the immediate task that are to be executed
5. ensure that 
5.1 Created a docker-compose for mongodb and mongodb ui
5.1. verify if mongodb and mongodb ui is working as expected
5.2 verify if schema and seed data are in place as expected
5.3 create a shellscript to verify mongodb, mongodb ui, schema, seed data,  db operations based on the application functionaility. create mongodb status report
5.4 fix all the mongodb issues if you find any
5.5 move to express api
6.0 back-end
6.1 back-end is written in express js
6.2 all the endpoints required are build in express js
6.3 verify if all the end points are working
6.3.1 create folder express-api-curl-test-scripts
6.3.2 create script for each end point
6.3.3 each end point will have its own curl testing script
6.4 create end to end api script to test express is working as expected
6.5 if express api are working as expected move to angular front-end
7.0 angular front-end
7.1 verify all the functionality is created for angular front-end
7.2 based on the step 7.1 complete the all the pending implementation
7.3 create end to end ui testing to ensure the application is working as expected
7.4 create a e2e testing report

Repeate all the steps till entire todo application with MEAN Stack is work end to end
